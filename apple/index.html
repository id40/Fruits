      <p>
        An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica).
        Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown
        species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where
        its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have
        been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to
        North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and
        mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and
        European Christian tradition.
