      <p>
        In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants
        (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.
        Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible
        fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans and
        animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and
        nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on
        fruits as a source of food.
